# neural-network-time-series
This project focuses on building an end-to-end deep learning system for forecasting future values of a multivariate time series dataset. The goal is to design, train, and evaluate a neural network–based forecasting model, apply explainability techniques, and analyze how different input features contribute to the model’s predictions.
